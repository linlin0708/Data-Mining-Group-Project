# Project Specifications: Financial Loan Analytics System
**Course:** WIE 3007 – Data Mining (Universiti Malaya)
**Type:** Group Project (GitHub Based)

## 1. Objective
Develop an AI-enhanced data mining pipeline to simulate financial data, engineer features using LLMs, and build predictive models for Risk, Loan Topics, and Approved Amounts.

## 2. Tech Stack
* **Environment:** Google Colab (T4 GPU), Cursor (Code Editing)
* **Version Control:** GitHub (Individual Branches required)
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `transformers` (Hugging Face), `sdv` (Synthetic Data), `matplotlib/seaborn`.

## 3. Dataset Schema
**Target Size:** 1,500+ rows
**Base Columns:**
* `CustomerID` (ID)
* `Income` (Numeric)
* `Account Balance` (Numeric)
* `Credit Score` (Numeric)
* `Loan Purpose Text` (Free text)
* `Total Loan Applied` (Numeric)

**AI-Generated/Derived Columns:**
* `Topic`: Extracted from `Loan Purpose Text` (Classes: Medical, Business, Reno, etc.)
* `Risk Category`: Derived from Income/Score (Classes: High, Low)
* `Approved Amount`: Regression target based on applied amount & history.

## 4. Work Allocation & Modeling Tasks
The project is divided into three distinct prediction tasks.

### **Task 1: Topic Classification (Categorical)**
* **Owner:** ZY
* **Goal:** Predict `Topic` based on financial features.
* **Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest.

### **Task 2: Risk Category Classification (Categorical)**
* **Owner:** [John (User) & MingHang]
* **Goal:** Predict `Risk Category` (High/Low).
* **Input Features:** Income, Balance, Credit Score, Topic.
* **Models:** Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
* **Metrics:** Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Pie Chart.

### **Task 3: Loan Amount Prediction (Regression)**
* **Owner:** Wendy & JuenKai
* **Goal:** Predict `Approved Loan Amount`.
* **Models:** Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost.
* **Metrics:** RMSE, MAE.

## 5. Final Output Requirements
* **Business Insights:** generated by LLM based on model results.
* **Report:** 5-7 pages (PDF).
